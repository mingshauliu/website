I am a PhD student under supervision of Professor Carola Schönlieb at the [Cambridge Image Analysis Group](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis) within DAMTP. I am also a member of the [Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information](https://www.ccimi.maths.cam.ac.uk/) and the [Maths4DL programme](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/team-member/zak-shumaylov/).

I am interested in research in a wide variety of areas of applied mathematics, ranging from inverse problems to machine learning, optimisation, theoretical inflationary cosmology and others. My current research focuses on the areas of geometric deep learning and physics informed machine learning. 

I am currently looking for summer students in the areas described above and if any of those topics sound interesting - reach out, I am always happy to chat!

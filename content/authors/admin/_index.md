I am a PhD student in theoretical machine learning at [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/mary-letey) supervised by [Professor Cengiz Pehlevan](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/people/cengiz-pehlevan).

My general background and research spans a range of problems in applied mathematics, from early-universe cosmology to machine learning and machine learning for physics. I am excited to explore and develop techniques for understanding how neural network properties arise through complex localised interactions of neurons, as well as the role that symmetry and structure of data plays in such theories.

Currently I'm working on theoretical predictions for in-context learning with the Pehlevan Lab, highly-symmetric discretisations of relativistic geometries with [Professors Latham Boyle](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/latham-boyle) and [Jasper van Wezel](https://www.jvanwezel.com), and neural networks for PDEs with [Professor Siamak Ravanbakhsh](https://www.siamak.page) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/core-research/).

I am always happy to discuss cool maths and related topics, please reach out if you are interested!

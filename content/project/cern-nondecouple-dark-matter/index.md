  We studied non-composite dark matter as a beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scalar field charged under the Electroweak interaction in the context of geometric Effective Field Theory.  We focus on scalar Loryon models that acquire more than half the particleâ€™s mass from the Higgs mechanism and found four surviving BSM candidates using experimental bounds already established, including the scalar singlet and electroweak doublet, triplet, and quartet, all assumed to be colourless and carry additional Z2 charge to prohibit further decay. We compare the relic abundance result with previous studies and conclude that only the high-mas islands survive for the BSM scalar singlet if we accept that dark matter receives most of its mass from the Higgs.

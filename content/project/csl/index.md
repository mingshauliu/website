  Towards the goal of constructing discretisations of spacetime models that preserve as large of a discrete subgroup of Poincare symmetry as possible, we investigate lattices in maximally-symmetric relativistic geometries (i.e. Minkowski, de Sitter, and Anti-de Sitter spaces), and explore their properties and symmetry groups.

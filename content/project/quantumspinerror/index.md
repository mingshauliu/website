summary: Extending recent work pioneered by the Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Lab in approximating the groundstate wavefunction of a quantum lattice system using Recurrent Neural Networks. I investigated the affect of error and noisiness of the quantum data on the accuracy of the wavefunction and other physical quantities.

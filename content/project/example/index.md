summary: Investigating tree-level scatting amplitudes for gluons in Yang-Mills. By utilising colour decomposition, we investigate partial amplitude formulas in the case of 3 negative-helicity gluons. In particular, we investigate the singularity structure of the partial amplitude using projective geometry.

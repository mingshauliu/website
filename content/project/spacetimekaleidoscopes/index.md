  **Master's Thesis.** Towards constructing a mathematical framework to generalise the use of reflection groups in classifying discrete symmetries of Lorentzian spaces. We present a generalisation of the notion of crystallographic symmetry and demonstrate substantial differences between reflection groups in Euclidean and Lorentzian spaces. 
  
  **Supervisor:** [Professor Latham Boyle](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/latham-boyle).

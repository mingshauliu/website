summary: We construct a mathematical framework to generalise the use of reflection groups in classifying discrete symmetries of Lorentzian spaces, inspired by both the immense mathematical applicability of familiar Coxeter theory and potential applications to discrete models of spacetimes. With this goal, we present a generalisation of the notion of crystallographic symmetry, and argue its necessity. Utilising this generalisation, we show how properties of reflection groups and mirror hyper- planes in Euclidean space turn out to be vastly different from Lorentzian spaces.
